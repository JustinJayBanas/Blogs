                        Our internship began with an orientation led by the dean. Ate Ella guided us to our assigned department, BU-USDS, where we met our mentor. Our team has two IT students and one CBEM student. Our mentor explained our tasks, which include fixing their system and adding new features.
                        <br>
                        Day 2:
                        We helped renovate tables and organize documents in the office. After that, we started checking the spreadsheet monitoring system to find what needed fixing.
                        <br>
                        Day 3:
                        There was a power outage, so Sir Ronaldo gave me clerical work. I checked documents to make sure they were complete and organized.</p>
